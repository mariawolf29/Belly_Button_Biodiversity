# The goals of this challenge

## Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
When an individual’s ID is selected, the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) should be visualized with a bar chart. Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
*	Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
*	Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
*	Use otu_labels as the hover text for the chart.

## Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
*	Use otu_ids for the x-axis values.
*	Use sample_values for the y-axis values.
*	Use sample_values for the marker size.
*	Use otu_ids for the marker colors.
*	Use otu_labels for the text values.

## Complete the demographic information panel.
Display all the key-value pairs of the selected individual’s demographic data.
